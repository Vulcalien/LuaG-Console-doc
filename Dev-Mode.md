# LuaG Console - Developer Mode - 0.6.2

LuaG Console works in two modes: `user` and `developer`.\
User mode is default, so you have to switch to Developer mode using the [shell command](https://github.com/Vulcalien/LuaG-Console/wiki/Shell-and-Commands) `mode d`.

Dev mode offers many tools that allow help you create a game:
- integrated game editor (open with `edit`)
- commands like `setup`, `files` and `pack`

In Dev Mode you can **restart the game** using `F7` and **stop the game** using `F8`
