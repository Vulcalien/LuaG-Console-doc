# LuaG Console - Developer Mode - 0.6.3

LuaG Console has two modes: `user` and `developer`.\
The default one is *user*, but you can switch to *dev* using the [shell command](https://github.com/Vulcalien/LuaG-Console/wiki/Shell-and-Commands) `mode d`.

Dev mode offers tools that help you create a game:
- [integrated game editor](https://github.com/Vulcalien/LuaG-Console/wiki/Game-Editor) (open with `edit`)
- commands like `setup`, `files` and `pack`

In Dev Mode you can **restart the game** using `F7` and **stop the game** using `F8`
