# LuaG Console - Dev Mode - 0.5.0

Dev mode is used when creating the game.  
It is activated passing the argument `-dev` when running the console.  
Here is an example:
```batch
java -jar console.jar -dev
```

This mode allows the developer to use utilities:
- cmd
- integrated editor
- stop the game (using `F8`)

## Cmd
When opening the console in dev mode, it will show the cmd.  
In the cmd you can write commands:
- `run` to start the game
- `edit` to start the editor
- `help` to get a list of all the commands

## Integrated Editor
The integrated editor offers a map editor.
