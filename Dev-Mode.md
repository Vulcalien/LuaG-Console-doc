# LuaG Console - Developer Mode - 0.6.0

LuaG Console works on two modes: `user` and `developer`.  
User mode is default, so you have to switch to Developer mode using the [shell command](https://github.com/Vulcalien/LuaG-Console/wiki/Shell-and-Commands) `mode d`.

Dev mode offers many tools that allow help you create a game:
- integrated game editor (open with `edit`)
- stop the game (using `F8`)
- commands like `setup`, `files` and `pack`

Using this mode, you have to run the console *once* and you won't need to close it while developing your game!
