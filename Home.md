# LuaG Console - Home - 0.4.1

## How do I install luaG Console?
If you just want to make a game then you can [download a release](https://github.com/Vulcalien/LuaG-Console/wiki/Download), but you can also clone the repository inside your Java IDE and compile the console.  
(Note that if you clone the repository, `console-userdata` will contain my test game)

## How can I make a Game?
Just install and code! Read [Lua Script](Lua-Script) Page.

## How can I publish my Game?
Pack the **console** (jar file and LICENSE) and **console-userdata** inside a **zip file** and publish the zip.  
The final user will just run the .jar and type the command `run` in the internal cmd.  
If you want it to automatically run the game, you can use a tool such as Launch4j and set the EXE file's arguments to '-run'.

## I am getting confused! What files/folders should I modify?
Read the page [Files and Folders](Files-and-Folders).
