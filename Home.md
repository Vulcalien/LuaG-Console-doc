# LuaG Console - Home - 0.6.2

LuaG Console is a fantasy console that allows you to make games really quickly!

## Game API
It can be programmed using *lua* 5.2 scripts and offers game-dedicated utilities: there is an integrated map system, sounds, input handler and all the screen functions you need!

## Integrated Game editor
LuaG has an [integrated editor](https://github.com/Vulcalien/LuaG-Console/wiki/Game-Editor) for the **map** and the **sprites** that can help the developer make his game.  
To open it, you have to be in [dev mode](https://github.com/Vulcalien/LuaG-Console/wiki/Dev-Mode) and type `edit`.

## Use as a player
It's easy for players to play. They just need to download the console and the cartridge of the game they want to play, put the cartridge file on the same folder of the jar file, open the console, type `run {cartridge-name}` and the game will start!

## How to create a game
To start coding, you first have to get blank game files. To do this, type `mode d` to switch to [dev mode](https://github.com/Vulcalien/LuaG-Console/wiki/Dev-Mode) and then type `setup`.  
*lua* is a really easy language to use. If you don't know how to code in *lua*, there are lots of tutorials on the Internet.

## Backward compatibility
Cartridges will keep working on future versions: backward compatibility is one of the goals of LuaG Console!

## Getting involved
If you notice a bug, or you would like to have something made different, you can [report an issue](https://github.com/Vulcalien/LuaG-Console/issues). You will get an answer as soon as possible!
