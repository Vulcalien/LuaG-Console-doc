# LuaG Console - Home - 0.5.0

## How do I install luaG Console?
If you want to make a game using LuaG Console then you can [download a release](https://github.com/Vulcalien/LuaG-Console/wiki/Download).  
Releases contain blank game files that you will modify.

## How can I make a Game?
LuaG Console uses [Lua Language](https://www.lua.org/) for its scripts.  
The console offers a library for things such as *rendering*, *map*, *sounds* and *key input*.  
Read about [Lua Script](Lua-Script).  
When developing the game, remember to run the console in [Dev Mode](Dev-Mode).

## How can I publish my Game?
Pack the **console** and **game files** (console-userdata) inside a *zip file* and publish it.  
The final user will just double-click on the .jar file and the game will start.

## I am getting confused! What files/folders should I modify?
Read the page [Files and Folders](Files-and-Folders).
