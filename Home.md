# LuaG Console - Home - 0.6.2

LuaG Console is a fantasy console that allows you to make games really quickly!

## Game API
It can be programmed using *lua* 5.2 scripts and offers a game-dedicated API: there is an integrated map system, sounds, input handler and all the screen functions you need!

## Integrated Game editor
LuaG has an [integrated editor](https://github.com/Vulcalien/LuaG-Console/wiki/Game-Editor) for the **map** and the **sprites** that can help the developer making his game.

## Easy for players
It is easy to use for players too! They just need to download the console and the game thay want to play, put the cartridge file on the same folder of the jar file, type `run {cartridge-name}` and... it's done!

## Really simple to code
To start coding, you first have to get blank game files. To do this, type `mode d` to switch to [dev mode](https://github.com/Vulcalien/LuaG-Console/wiki/Dev-Mode) and then type `edit`.
*lua* is a really easy language to use. If you don't know how to code in *lua*, there are lots of tutorials on the Internet.

## Frequent Updates (with backward compatibility)
LuaG is always under development adding new tools, improving the API and bug fixes. However, cartridges will keep working on future versions: backward compatibility is one of the goals of LuaG Console!
