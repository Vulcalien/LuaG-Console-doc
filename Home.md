# LuaG Console - Home - 0.6.3

LuaG Console is a fantasy console that allows you to make games really quickly!

## Game API
The console uses *lua* 5.2 scripts. The game API allows you to easily interact with game dedicated features: map, sound, input and screen.

## Game editor
LuaG Console offers a [game editor](https://github.com/Vulcalien/LuaG-Console/wiki/Game-Editor). It helps create the **map** and **sprites**.\
To open it, you have to be in [dev mode](https://github.com/Vulcalien/LuaG-Console/wiki/Dev-Mode) and type `edit`.

## Playing games
It's easy to play games on LuaG Console. The player needs to download the console and the cartridge of the game, put the cartridge file on the same folder of the console (.jar) file, open the console and finally type `run {cartridge-name}`. Done!

## How to create a game
First of all, you need blank game files. Open the console and type `mode d` to switch to [developer mode](https://github.com/Vulcalien/LuaG-Console/wiki/Dev-Mode).\
Now, type `setup`. It's time to code: read [Lua Script](https://github.com/Vulcalien/LuaG-Console/wiki/Lua-Script) to learn more.\
*lua* is a really easy language to use. If you don't know how to code in *lua*, there are lots of tutorials on the Internet.

## Backward compatibility
Cartridges will keep working on future versions: backward compatibility is one of the goals of LuaG Console!

## Getting involved
If you notice a bug, or you would like to have something made different, you can [report an issue](https://github.com/Vulcalien/LuaG-Console/issues). You will get an answer as soon as possible!
