# LuaG Console 0.6.3 - Changelog

Notable features added in this update are the possibility to resize the console and changes to the *lua* interface. Also, the *lua* interpreter will not load all the default libraries anymore.

## Major features
- **Resize and full-screen**: the console can now be resized or set to full-screen (using `F11`)
- **`log` command**: it opens console's log file in the default text editor
- **Movable cursor in shell**: the shell's cursor can now be moved
- Default *lua* library is not fully loaded anymore for security (a full list on bottom);  
  `require` is also disabled; use `loadscript` instead

## Minor features
- Console pauses when iconified
- Sprite editor's history now saves the whole atlas
- Sprite editor now has zoom for 1 or 4 tiles
- Log files now always end with `.log`
- Better error messages for bad arguments passed to functions

## Interface changes (1.3)
- spr function now supports rotation and flipping  
  note: this is the order of transformations: flip -> rotate -> scale  
  new signature: spr(id, x, y, *scale, *sw, *sh, *rot, *hflip, *vflip)
- `log` function: logs something as INFO in the log file  
  signature: log(x)
- Some function (sound ones and `write`) now automatically convert to strings non-string arguments

## Bug fixes
- keys not releasing when focus is lost
- Invalid `.cartridge-info` or `config.json` game files cause the console to crash
- Map's max size is 255x255, while it should be 256x256
